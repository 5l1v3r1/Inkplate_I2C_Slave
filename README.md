# Inkplate I2C Slave

This is the second half of a two-part demonstration, where a [BastWAN](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/Bast-WAN) acts as the master and sends messages to an ESP32 slave, in this case an [Inkplate 6](https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-Arduino-library).

It uses on the ESP32 the [ESP32 I2C Slave library](https://github.com/gutierrezps/ESP32_I2C_Slave).

The first half of the demonstration is [here](https://github.com/Kongduino/BastWAN_I2C_Master).
